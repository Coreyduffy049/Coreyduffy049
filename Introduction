Welcome to my profile!
My name is Corey Duffy, whom has a passion and drive for technology and games. This came from a young age from playing PS1 to now building games within games engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. 
Currently I am sitting an L5 FdSc Games Technologies at Newcastle College where I have gladly taken the opportunity to delve deep into the intricoes of software development and algorithms. 
Throughout my degree I have gained a solid foundation in various programming languages such as C# and C++ which has allowed me to develop an array of knowledge in adapting and problem-solving code when implementing specialised mechanics throughout the production of building games.
I provide a pleather of likeable traits alongside the willingness to learn and improvement in a rapidly progressive career field. 
I believe my confidence is ever present when in challenging situations pushing my own limits and also ensuring if others are involved vice versa also.
